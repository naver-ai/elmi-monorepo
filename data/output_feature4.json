        "description": "The word 'heavy' is translated to 'intense' to better capture the meaning in ASL. The concept of 'hearing' the bass is conveyed through feeling its vibration, which is more natural for Deaf individuals, combined with an intense facial expression. The phrase 'I\u2019m ready' remains the same but with appropriate pause and indication of readiness."
