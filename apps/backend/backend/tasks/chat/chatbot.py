    1. Meaning: Questions about understanding or interpreting the lyrics.
    2. Glossing: Questions about how to sign specific words or phrases. {{sign_language}} translation. 
    If there's already user created gloss, Questions about how to improve their gloss.
    3. Emoting: Questions about expressing emotions through facial expressions and body language.
    4. Timing: Questions about the timing of the gloss, including changing and adjusting the gloss (shorter or longer).

    Classify the user query into one of these categories:
    - Meaning
    - Glossing
    - Emoting
    - Timing
    - Other: Messages that do not fall within the above four categories.
                         
    Here are some examples of user queries for each category:
    - Meaning: "What is the deeper meaning of this line?"
